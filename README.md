Due to the sheer size of a unity project; I am only sharing the Assets, Packages, and Project Setting folders.

The Assets and Project Settings folders are probably the only folders you will actually need to copy as it includes the relevant sprite and script.

Note: You may need to change the setting related to under Edit > Project Settings > Player >Other Settings > Active Input Handling > Both (It required me two restarts) due to how the tutorial implements keyboard input

Hopefully copying the Project Setting folder into the project bypasses this whole process.

The Packages folder should be default but was included since it was recommended to push these three files onto a github for unity.
